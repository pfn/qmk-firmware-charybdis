# KB2040 controller charybdis 3x5+3 support

Drop this repo into qmk_firmware/keyboards/pfn/charybdis/

Supports:

* KB2040
* Cirque Glidepoint
* Encoder
* Other firmware niceties

Notes:
* info.json matrix is slightly swapped to be compatible with crkbd layouts
  but swaps the inner and outer thumb keys because of positioning makes the
  inner-most thumb key uncomfortable for my primary space/enter usage
